# vehicledata
This project performs some very basic exploratory analysis on a set of vehicle listings circa 2019. The main purpose is to demo web development, which was implemented via Python using Streamlit, and hosted by Render. Data was handled and visualized using the Pandas library and Plotly Express, respectively.
